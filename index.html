            <p class="intro">Hi! I'm Alla Dankanych </p>
            <p>I am a software engineer, wife, and stay at home mom.</p>
            <p> I currently reside in Lexington,Kentucky. </p>

        <div class="item-double">

        <p>I was born in Russia and moved with my family to America when I was only 4 years old. We lived in Denver, Colorado for 16 years, before my family moved to North Port, Florida. That is where I met my husband. Recently, my husband and I moved to Lexington, Kentucky.</p>
        <p>In my free time I love to put puzzles together. Unlike most people, I find the challange of a puzzle relaxing. If it's not a puzzle, it will be sudoko, or any other activity that has my brain working. If you're looking to hire a new software engineer to your team, please reach out! I am excited to work with others to build great software.</p>
        <p>I came across coding while I was working on a course for my Bachelors Accounting. I found that it was something that sparked my interest. A challange I had not yet faced. A few years later, I decided it was time to purse something I had been thinking about since that course. As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software engineer. I am excited about this new journey of my life. </p>

                <p>The Portfolio section is your opprotunity to show off all your past projects. Try to showcase your strongest projects first. At this point, you may not really have any work to share, but use an existing code sample as a fun starting point. Of course, if you have any projects that you would like to share, please do!</p>
